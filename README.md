# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

## Usage

### Install npm dependencies
In order to install, you need to run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Deployment for production

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "serverless-http-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack serverless-http-api-dev (91s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: serverless-http-api-dev-hello (1.6 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [HTTP API (API Gateway V2) event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api).

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `dev` command:

```
serverless dev
```

This will start a local emulator of AWS Lambda and tunnel your requests to and from AWS Lambda, allowing you to interact with your function as if it were running in the cloud.

Now you can invoke the function as before, but this time the function will be executed locally. Now you can develop your function locally, invoke it, and see the results immediately without having to re-deploy.

When you are done developing, don't forget to run `serverless deploy` to deploy the function to the cloud.

### Unit test

In order to run unit test, you need to run the following command:

```
npx jest
```

### Open API/Swagger

In file swagger.yml for open-api and postman in SOFTTEK.postman_collection.json
